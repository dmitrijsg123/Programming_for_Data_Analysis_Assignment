# Programming_for_Data_Analysis_Assignment - Practical Assignment 2020

Numpy.random

The assignment answers the following questions:
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Overall purpose of the package
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
Numpy.random subpackage has the ability to generate randomness of data, shuffle existing data and draw samples based on a specified distribution.

2.1. Simple Random Data

Random.random() 

Random.rand() function

Random.randn() 

Random.randint() 

Random.sample() function

Random.choice() function

2.2 Permutations
  1. Shuffle() function
  2. Permutations function

3. Distributions.

  Uniform distribution
  
  Normal distribution
  
  Binomial distribution
  
  Gamma distribution
  
  
  Logistic distribution
  
4. Seeds
Different ways of generating a seed in pseudo-random numbers.

5. Generator
PCG64 generator, its advantages over Mersenne Twister generator.
